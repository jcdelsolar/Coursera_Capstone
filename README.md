## Introduction
Nowadays one of the main causes of death in the road are car accidents, these are caused due to known conditions like weather, state of the road, etc.

The purpose of this Capstone Project is to build a data science model that would help Us whether a car accident would cause property damage only or be an injury collision in the worst case scenario.

This project is designed to help the local authorities take better decisions about car accident prevention and also for the public in general that could use this information as a tool to make better choices in their daily life.
