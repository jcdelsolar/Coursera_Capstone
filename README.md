# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is to share my work for a Coursera project

## Introduction
Nowadays one of the main causes of death in the road are car accidents, these are caused due to known conditions like weather, state of the road, etc. The purpose of this Capstone Project is to build a data science model that help Us predict the possibility of getting into a car accident and the severity of it. This project is designed to help the local authorities take better decisions about car accident prevention and also for the public in general that could use this information as a tool to make better choices in their daily life.

## Data
To build this model We will use the shared data of traffic collisions from Seattle City. We will analyze the traffic collisions variables like weather condition, road condition, car speed and light conditions.
